# Computer vision project
When starting a computer vision project, finding or creating a labeled training dataset
will most likely be the first challenge you will be facing. 
in this project:   
we use the florence-2 model (in inference) and flicker dataset for the creation of
annotations for a training dataset for the smaller model - YOLO8.
The training dataset include bounding boxes for the following
classes:  
■ person  
■ pet (union of dog and cat classes)  
-There are 500 training images and 100 validation images for each class

here are some examples:
